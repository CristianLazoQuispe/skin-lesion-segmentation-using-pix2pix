# skin lesion segmentation using pix2pix
Tensorflow implementation of [Skin cancer - semantic segmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks](__) by Cristian Lazo Quispe.




### Results on CIFAR10
Note that in this repo, only the unsupervised version was implemented for now. I reaplced the orginal architecture with DCGAN and the results are more colorful than the original one.

From 0 to 100 epochs:
